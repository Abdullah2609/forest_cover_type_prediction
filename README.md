# Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project predicts forest cover types using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training with LightGBM, and evaluation. The workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, with supporting documentation and dataset provided.

## Project Structure

- `forest_cover_prediction_model.ipynb` — Main notebook with code and analysis
- `train.csv` — Dataset used for model training and evaluation
- `project_description.pdf` — Project documentation and details

## Features

- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Feature scaling and preparation
- Train-test split for model validation
- LightGBM classifier training
- Model evaluation with accuracy and classification report

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- lightgbm

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn lightgbm
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and ensure all files (`.ipynb`, `.csv`, `.pdf`) are in the project directory.
2. Open `forest_cover_prediction_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
